A mighty warrior once declared he would kill every animal in the world but Gaea, the goddess of the Earth, angered by the warrior claims, sent a scorpion to kill him. Upon his demise, Zeus turned him into a constellation, along with the scorpion that killed him.

You might not know who this warrior is, but I'm sure you know the constellation he was turned into: The Orion constellation.

Hello, we are Plut√≥n, an interdisciplinary team of mathematicians, engineers and designers who is commited to share the importance of reading stories from the sky and passing them among our peers. 

Glancing at the sky with the naked eye in order to understand ourselves quickly turned into science. And with science came great progress, but at the cost of stargazing becoming a practice lost in time, now reserved for our best minds.

We now yearn for a way to nurture the natural curiosity that our vast universe generates in the youngest members of our society. There is a need for a way to get them into the beauty of space by doing what they do best: telling and creating stories.

Therefore, we want to introduce you Exomythology, an interactive 3D web platform for creating, discovering and sharing stories found within the firmament seen from a planet parsecs away from our homeland.

With Exomythology we'll be enabling and encouraging kids to gaze at the starry sky from remote planets, allowing them to create constelations and write passionate mythology about them. This mythology can be shared in many accesible ways, such as audio or text, with an equally devoted community.

We are sure Exomythology will change the way kids see the stars, and we aim for a future where Exomythology is in every school; accesible through VR, a computer or even a phone. 

Exomythology is our bet on a new generation of stargazers, commited scientists and wholehearted storytellers.

Thank you all for your attention!
