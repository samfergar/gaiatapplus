# Project Name
**Exomythology**

# High-Level Project Summary
🌌 Since ancient times, humans have looked at the sky to admire the beauty of the stars ✨ and find in them answers to some of the most deepest questions of life. From generation to generation, the stars remain in the firmament, sheltering our earth and shining for us, but most importantly, serving as an excuse to reunite and tell **stories** 📖

Stargazing 🌠 serves as a way to sit in the pitch black night with our kin, our friends and our loved ones to tell stories of great warriors, fierceful beasts, love rendezvous and passionate friendships. Stories that were told some day centuries ago remain relevant today, passing between eras ⌛ and all across the world 🌎, adding our own twists and beliefs, helping each and one of us buid our cosmovision 🌌

But... What would these stars look like from other worlds? 🪐 What kind of stories could we tell if we saw them from other perspectives? 🔭

We want to bring back the warmth and familiarity that can only be obtained by reading stories in the breathtaking sky that sits above us 🌠, but seen from another world: an **exoplanet**. Our deepest desire is to make a place for reunion by finding out what kind of epic stories can be told reading the celestial bodies from a whole new perspective. We yearn for these stories to pass down between the new generations; let them take shape within the river of time ⏳ and the vision of new stargazers 🔭 in order to expand their horizons, just like it happened with the stories of our elders

**Exomythology** is an interactive 3D web platform 🌐 that allows users to create, explore, share and comment stories gazing at the stars, creating and admiring constellations standing on different exoplanets 🪐. Users will be able to live the ancient tradition of storytelling under the shiny sky of a planet light-years away from our earth 🌌, and it will enable and encourage them to share these stories among their peers 👥. **Exomythology** comes to bring back the curiosity and passion of our species for the most arcane knowledge found within the stars 🌠
